### Welcome!

- PhD in Applied Mathematics at Jadavpur University. 

I am mainly interested in computer vision and deep learning. My current research is related to tokamak research, micro fluid dynamics, and deep neural networks applied to a wide range of domains, from generative AI to natural language processing. I am also broadly interested in data engineering and data science.
